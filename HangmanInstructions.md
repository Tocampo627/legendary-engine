Welcome to hangman 
Here are the rules:

In the game of hangman, there is a secret word you must guess
You can only guess one letter at the time
You will be prompted to enter a letter until you run out of chances or guess the entire word.

Three things can happen:

The letter you enter does not exist in the message
    The game will notify the user that the letter does not exist and either describe or print the hangman body part or list the number of tries left?
The letter has already been attempted or guessed correctly
    If the letter has been used before then the game will notify the player and ask for a dif letter 
The letter is correct 
    Then the game tells the player that it is correct and either displays the letters and missing spaces

The game will continue until the player either:

Discovers  the secret word 
    The game will congratulate the player and ask if they want to play again
Or the player runs out of tries
    The game will reveal the word and ask players if they want to play again
